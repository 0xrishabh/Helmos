# Problem Statement:

The challenge addressed by Helmos is the safe and secure management of digital assets in the event of unforeseen events, such as lost keys, accidents, or death.
Current solutions are centralized and contradict the trustlessness ethos of Safe.

# Solution Overview:

Helmos leverages Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and the Axiom protocol to recover wallets securely and trustlessly.
Users can set conditions for asset rescue, such as a specific period of inactivity, ensuring funds are not lost forever.
The solution eliminates the need for trust in third parties and emphasizes security and privacy.
